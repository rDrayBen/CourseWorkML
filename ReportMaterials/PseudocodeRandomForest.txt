Pseudo code for the random forest algorithm

To generate c classifiers:
for i = 1 to c do
    Randomly sample the training data D with replacement to produce D;
    Create a root node, N, containing D,
    Call BuildTree(Ni)
end for

BuildTree(N):
if N contains instances of only one class then
    return
else
    Randomly select x% of the possible splitting features in N
    Select the feature F with the highest information gain to split on
    Create f child nodes of N, N1 .... , N , where F has f possible values (F,, ... , F)
    for i = 1 to f do
        Set the contents of N, to D1, where D, is all instances in N that match
        F
        Call BuildTree(Ni)
    end for
end if
